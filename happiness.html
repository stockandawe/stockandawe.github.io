                If you only wished to be happy, this could be easily accomplished; but we wish to be happier than other people,
                and this is always difficult, for we believe others to be happier than they are.

            <blockquote>
              Unhappiness comes from wanting what others have.
              <br/>
              Happiness comes from wanting what you already have.

            <blockquote>
              From Charlie Munger, on applying the mental model of inversion for happiness:
              <br/>
              Instead of asking how do I attain happiness, how can I avoid depression.
              <br/>
              Sleeping well, eating right, etc -- by doing that, you are 95% there to achieve happiness.
