Currently, I am the Cofounder & CTO of [Maxwell](https://himaxwell.com), a company that builds software and services to power the future of home financing.

Before Maxwell, I founded [Bright Funds](https://brightfunds.org) in 2012 with a mission to design experiences that unlock passion and capital from a new generation of donors focused on impact. Before creating Bright Funds, I worked in marketing, product design, and software engineering at various successful bay-area startups and venture-backed private companies including Coverity (acquired by Synopsys), Omneon (acquired by Harmonic), Topspin (acquired by Cisco) and Procket Networks (acquired by Cisco). For a chronological look at my background and experiences, you can find my resume on [Usybee](http://www.usybee.com/rutul-dave).

I was on CauseArtist’s list of [social entrepreneurs to watch for in 2014](http://causeartist.com/15-social-entrepreneurs-watch-2014). I have been an active voice on immigration reform in United States, and was [featured in The Wall Street Journal](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887324880504578298150540138218) and on a [KRON news segment](https://vimeo.com/64199097) on on startup visas.

When inspired to write, I share [my thoughts on startups, products, and design](https://medium.com/@letsfixtheworld). My essay on Agile software development was published in ‘[Creative Entrepreneurship](http://pandawhale.com/post/18062/creative-entrepreneurship-free-pdf-for-entrepreneurs)’, a collection of essays helping founders great build companies.

As an advisor, [engineer](https://github.com/stockandawe), [investor](https://angel.co/rutuldave), and a product consultant, I [help turn ideas into a successful companies](https://letsfixtheworld.github.io/).
