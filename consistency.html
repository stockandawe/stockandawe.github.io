              <blockquote>
                The consistency of your endeavors (exercise, companionship, work) is more important than the quantity.
                Nothing beats small things done every day which is way more important than what you do occasionally.

              <blockquote>
                “All the greatest prizes in life, in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from the magic of compounding interest by amplifying
                small steady gains. All you need for abundance is to keep adding 1% more than you subtract on a regular basis.”

              <blockquote>
                “27th. A man who defers working because he wants tranquillity of mind will have lost the habit when tranquillity comes.
                Work under any circumstances—all circumstances.
                I used to carry my sketch when arrested and sketch and compose as I sat by the officer's side.
                The consequence was I was always ready, never depressed, and returned to my work with a new thought or an
                additional improvement as if I had been all the time at home."
