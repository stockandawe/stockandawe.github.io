                "The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say “ I can do whatever I want to do.” 
                The ability to do what you want, when you want, with who you want, for as long as you want is priceless.

                Measure your wealth not by the things you can buy, but by the things that no money can buy.

              <blockquote>
                The rich have money.
                The wealthy have time. 
                It is easier to become wealthy than rich.

              <blockquote>
                My sister isn't super rich, but she lives a rich lifestyle. She gets to walk her kids to school. 
                They stop for chocolate croissants. She works out with her friends outside. She can take a nap in the middle of the day with no guilt.
                
                That's winning! You don't have to become a billionaire to have max joy.
