        <h2>Frameworks that explain why things happen the way they do</h2>

        <div class="principle-content">
          <h3>1) Parkinson's Law</h3>
          <blockquote>
            This concept suggests that work expands to fill the time allotted for its completion. It implies that if more time is given to complete a task, it will likely consume that entire time, often resulting in less efficiency.
          </blockquote>

          <h3>2) Chesterton's Fence</h3>
          <blockquote>
            This principle states that before removing or altering something traditional or customary, one should understand why it was put in place in the first place. It warns against change for change's sake, emphasizing the importance of understanding the historical context and purpose of existing systems or practices.
          </blockquote>

          <h3>3) Law of Diminishing Returns</h3>
          <blockquote>
            This economic principle suggests that if one input in the production of a commodity is increased while other inputs are held constant, a point will be reached at which additions of the input yield progressively smaller, or diminishing, increases in output. It highlights the limits of increasing productivity by merely adding more of a single input.
          </blockquote>

          <h3>4) Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)</h3>
          <blockquote>
            This principle suggests that in many situations, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. It can be applied in various fields, from economics to management, highlighting the importance of focusing on the few key factors that drive most of the results.
          </blockquote>

          <h3>5) Butterfly Effect</h3>
          <blockquote>
            This concept from chaos theory suggests that small changes can have large effects. It implies that complex systems can be sensitive to initial conditions, and minor variations can lead to significantly different outcomes over time.
          </blockquote>

          <h3>6) Tacitus Razor</h3>
          <blockquote>
            This concept suggests that to understand who controls a society, one should look at who is not allowed to be criticized. It implies that those who are beyond reproach often hold significant power or influence in a society.
          </blockquote>

          <h3>7) Lindy Effect</h3>
          <blockquote>
            This concept, derived from observations in the New York restaurant industry, suggests that the longer a non-perishable item has been in existence, the longer its future life expectancy. It implies that older ideas, practices, or technologies may be more robust and likely to endure than newer ones.
          </blockquote>

          <h3>8) Murphy's Law</h3>
          <blockquote>
            It states that anything that can go wrong will go wrong. In some formulations, it is extended to "Anything that can go wrong will go wrong, and at the worst possible time." It has become a popular way to describe the tendency for things to go wrong in unexpected ways.
          </blockquote>

          <h3>9) Dunning-Kruger Effect</h3>
          <blockquote>
            This psychological principle suggests that people with low ability at a task often overestimate their ability, while those who excel at a task often underestimate their ability. It highlights the importance of self-awareness and the potential for cognitive bias in self-assessment.
          </blockquote>

          <h3>10) Occam's Razor</h3>
          <blockquote>
            This principle suggests that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. It encourages the use of the simplest possible hypothesis to explain phenomena, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
